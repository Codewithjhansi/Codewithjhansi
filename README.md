### 🧬 Who Am I?

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student with a love for Artificial Intelligence & Cloud Technology.  
🧠 I build models that can *see*, *understand*, and *respond*.  
☁️ I deploy those models into the cloud where they work 24/7 — no coffee needed.  
🧑‍🏫 Currently grinding DSA in Java, prepping for high-paying tech roles.  
🧭 Dreaming of a role where I can code, cloud, and innovate!
